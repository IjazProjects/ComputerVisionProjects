# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my collection of computer vision projects! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my work in various aspects of computer vision, utilizing different techniques and algorithms to solve real-world problems. Below you will find a brief overview of each project included in this repository.

## Image Classification with CNNs

This project focuses on the task of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the Food-101 dataset. I have implemented and compared four different models to explore various approaches within the domain of deep learning for image recognition:

- **Basic CNN**: A simple CNN model serving as a baseline for comparison.
- **All CNN**: An architecture that solely relies on convolutional layers, eliminating traditional dense layers.
- **Regularized CNN**: A CNN model with added regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained networks to improve our model's performance on the Food-101 dataset.

For more detailed information on the methodologies, architectures, and results, please refer to the project report included in this repository. Please note that due to size limitations on GitHub, the models themselves are not currently provided.


## RANSAC Image Stitching

In this project, I have applied the RANSAC algorithm to perform image stitching, combining two images into one seamless panorama. This technique is particularly useful in constructing wide-angle views from a series of overlapping images.


## Motion Detection with Kalman Filters

Utilizing video footage, this project aims to track and detect object movement through the implementation of Kalman filters. This method provides a robust approach to estimating the trajectories of moving objects in the presence of variable motion or occlusions.
